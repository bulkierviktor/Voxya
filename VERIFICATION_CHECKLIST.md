## âœ… Documentation Created
- [x] IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md - 133 lines
- [x] CHANGES_SUMMARY.md - 196 lines
- [x] VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md - this file

## âœ… Code Quality Checks
- [x] All braces balanced (verified)
- [x] All public APIs preserved
- [x] Unity namespaces correct
- [x] MonoBehaviour inheritance correct
- [x] Serializable attributes applied
- [x] Comments and documentation added
- [x] No compilation errors expected

## âœ… Requirements Met

### Chunk Parameters
- [x] chunkSize = 16
- [x] chunkHeight = 100

### View Distance
- [x] viewDistanceInChunks default = 3
- [x] Can be configured to 4 in Unity Editor

### Biomes (5 types)
- [x] Plains (height multiplier 0.8)
- [x] Hills (height multiplier 1.5)
- [x] Desert (height multiplier 0.9)
- [x] Snow (height multiplier 1.3)
- [x] Forest (height multiplier 1.0)

### City Parameters
- [x] cityCount = 5
- [x] minCityDistance = 40 chunks
- [x] maxCityDistance = 80 chunks
- [x] First city: 3-6 chunks from origin
- [x] City radius: 2-4 chunks (variable)

### Streaming Behavior
- [x] ChunkUpdateCoroutine runs every 0.2s
- [x] CreateChunkRoutine yields 1 frame per chunk
- [x] Chunks load around player dynamically
- [x] Chunks unload when outside view distance
- [x] Player controls enabled immediately

### City Spawning
- [x] City prefab instantiated if assigned
- [x] Gold placeholder cube (10x20x10) if prefab null
- [x] Spawned at city center chunk
- [x] Parented under "Cities" GameObject

### Organization
- [x] Chunks parented under "Chunks" GameObject
- [x] Cities parented under "Cities" GameObject

### Code Structure
- [x] BiomeManager - modular, reusable
- [x] CityManager - modular, reusable
- [x] WorldData - serializable
- [x] All managers initialized in WorldGenerator.Start()

### API Compatibility
- [x] Chunk.GetBlock(int x, int y, int z) - preserved
- [x] WorldGenerator.GetChunk(int x, int z) - preserved
- [x] WorldGenerator.GetBlockAt(Vector3) - preserved
- [x] Chunk.Initialize signature updated (required change)
- [x] All callers updated to use new signature

### Integration Points
- [x] BiomeManager.GetBiomeAtChunk() called in CreateChunkRoutine
- [x] BiomeManager.GetBiomeHeightMultiplier() called in Chunk.GetTerrainHeight
- [x] CityManager.GetCityAtChunk() called in CreateChunkRoutine
- [x] CityManager.GetCityCenterAtChunk() called in CreateChunkRoutine
- [x] Chunk.Initialize called with biome parameter
- [x] WorldGenerator.GetBlockAt used by Chunk.IsFaceVisible

## âœ… Commits
1. [x] "Initial plan" - Planning commit
2. [x] "Add new biome and city management system with streaming chunks" - Main implementation
3. [x] "Add MeshCollider requirement and implementation notes" - Fixes and docs
4. [x] "Add comprehensive implementation summary and documentation" - Final docs

## âœ… Branch Status
- [x] Working on branch: feature/streaming-biomes-cities
- [x] All commits merged to feature branch
- [x] Ready for PR to main branch

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Complete
All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented.

### Key Achievements
- âœ… Modular design (BiomeManager, CityManager separate classes)
- âœ… Minimal breaking changes (only Initialize signature changed)
- âœ… Streaming chunk generation around player
- âœ… Deterministic world generation from seed
- âœ… Variable biome heights
- âœ… City generation with proper spacing
- âœ… Placeholder support when no city prefab
- âœ… Throttled generation (performance optimized)
- âœ… Preserved all public APIs
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation

### Next Steps (for user in Unity Editor)
1. Open project in Unity
2. Locate WorldGenerator GameObject in scene
3. Configure parameters:
   - Assign player reference
   - Assign chunkPrefab
   - Optionally assign cityPrefab (or leave null for placeholder)
   - Adjust seed, viewDistance, city parameters as desired
4. Press Play
5. Watch chunks stream around player with biomes and cities!
